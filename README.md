# GP-booking-system-for-elderly-people
The aim was to create an improved user experience for the elderly, as current research suggests that they may face potential difficulties with recent technologies. This was done by looking at previous research on design issues and requirements for elderly people using smartphones. A set of system and design requirements were gathered to develop an interactive prototype using Sketch and Marvel App. The interactive prototype can be found here: https://marvelapp.com/prototype/547agfh/screen/66715587
